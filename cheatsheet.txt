    All the scripts will be in the directory ~/fabric-tools A typical sequence for Hyperledger Composer use would be

    Copy
    cd ~/fabric-tools
    ./downloadFabric.sh
    ./startFabric.sh
    ./createPeerAdminCard.sh


    ***

    Then at the end of your development session

    Copy
    cd ~/fabric-tools
    ./stopFabric.sh
    ./teardownFabric.sh

    
    Please note: The development environment created will include a PeerAdmin identity including the cryptographic material necessary for deploying business networks.
